# manga-api

Python-based web scraping tool built with FastAPI that provides easy access to manga content from the mangareader.to website. This API allows users to retrieve up-to-date information about various manga titles, chapters, and pages, enabling developers to create their own manga-related applications and services.

### Local Setup

#### Using Poetry (recommended)
We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as our package manager. So make sure you've poetry installed.
Also we use [gnu make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (optional)

**Step 1**: Clone this repo and `cd` into root directory.
**Step 2**: Setup `poetry`
```bash
poetry install
# or make poetry
```
**Step 3**: Activate `poetry shell`
**Step 4**: Finally run app
```bash
poetry run python3 main.py
# or make dev
```

#### Using pip
**Step 1**: Clone this repo and `cd` into root directory.
**Step 2**: Create a virtual env (recommended) and activate it ([venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html))
**Step 3**: Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Step 4**: Finally run app with `python3 main.py`

**Done, now you're good to go!**
